# Python Live Project
 python/django/pycharm live project
<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p> This repository contains a website built out with Django/pycharm that allows for the user to create a booklist with title, author, date finished, and a review of the book. It also contains an API that returns the top 15 best sellers on the New York Times list for that month, to assist the user in finding new reading material. This project was completed over a two week period with a daily standup meeting while working in an Agile/Scrum enviorment. 
<h2> Skills Acquired </h2>
<p>During this project I learned how to work in an agile/scrum enviorment, additional Django/python/html coding, as well as how to get a functioning API. Overall it was a very imformative two week sprint!</p>
<h3> create </h3>
<p>This is where I created the basic model of the website!

<h6>API </h6>
<p> For this update I went in and added an API that goes onto the new york times best sellers list and gets the 15 most reccomended books for that month. It also pulls the authors, title, and a URL so you can find the book online! </p>
