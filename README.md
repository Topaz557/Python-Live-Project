# Python Live Project
 python/django/pycharm live project
<h1> Introduction </h1>
<p> This repository contains a website built out with Django/pycharm that allows for the user to create a booklist with title, author, date finished, and a review of the book. It also contains an API that returns the top 15 best sellers on the New York Times list for that month, to assist the user in finding new reading material. 
<h2> create </h2>
<p>This is where I created the basic model of the website![BookList-Create](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99693735/183208852-51a02f4f-b856-4d6d-8c51-0272f88ba373.png)
.</p>
<h3> read</h3>
<p> This is where I added the functionality to allow for the user to see all added items to the data base, as well as the details of the added books.
<h4> Update and Delete</h4>
<p> Here I added the Update and Delete functionality, this allows for the user to go in and either delete or update the entry as they see fit. </p>
<h5>API </h5>
<p> For this update I went in and added an API that goes onto the new york times best sellers list and gets the 15 most reccomended books for that month. It also pulls the authors, title, and a URL so you can find the book online! </p>
<h6>Front end development </h6>
<p> Here I came in and added the front end styling via CSS to beautify the document</p>
